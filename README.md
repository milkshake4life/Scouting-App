# Scouting-App
This is a Scouting App for FRC team 589

User would watch a individual team, and record its performance on this app
The User would send the data to a database, which can then be pulled to create statistics
The User can also view every team's statistics on the app


Every method in main.py has comments explaining its purpose, and how it works
Every other file is a .kv(kivy file) that includes front end code
No comments are inside those .kv files
